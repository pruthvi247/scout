The smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention.
Volunteers do not necessarily have the time; they just have the heart.
Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.
The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
